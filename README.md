# deep-learning-on-windows

Supporting code for my post on installing/running deep learning frameworks on Windows.

## Theano.rc

`example_theanorc` is a simple `.theanorc` file that should be adapted to your installation of MSVC and GPU configuration.

## Examples

These examples were adapted from code in both the [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) examples directories. They are MIT-licenced, so this is acceptable use, but if either project desires me to remove/modify this code in any way please let me know and I'll do so ASAP.
